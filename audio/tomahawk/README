Tomahawk is a music player that fundamentally changes the way
music is consumed and shared. It decouples the name of the song
from the source it was shared from - and fulfills the request
using all of your available sources. This creates a universal
translation layer across music repositories, streaming services
and geographic territories.

This optionally requires libjreen (for connecting to jabber)
and qtweetlib (for connecting to twitter).
